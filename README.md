# what3words-integration
Mapworks integration with what3words. This allows you to:
- Click on the map and get the corresponding 3 words
- Allow the user to type in 3 words and zoom to the location
- Show the words immediately surrounding a chosen location
- Define the 3 words through a URL parameter

This includes a generic Mapworks API key, what3words API key and an OSM base map. Please replace these if you wish to embed the map into your own application. 

# Running the application
To execute this in Chrome or Firefox, simply double click the map.html file. Due to security constraints in Internet Explorer and Edge, these files will need to be hosted by a web server.
